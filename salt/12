Grains are bits of information about the underlying system, which can be
used in salt.

Here's a simple example.
Let's say we wanted to copy a file to a qube, but only if the qube was based on
Debian.

Let's create two test qubes, based on different templates, using salt.
create_test.sls

Now we can use grains to target the debian based qube, and copy a specific
file to it:

grain1.sls
qubesctl --targets test1,test2 state.apply

If you look at test2, you'll see there's a zero length file created there.
That's because the file is *managed*, but we didn't specify a source.

Let's unpack that sls:
{% if grains['os_family']|lower == 'debian' %}

We get the value of os_family , make it lowercase, and check if it matches
'debian'.
Simple.

Of course, we can use elif, and else as well.

grain2.sls

That starts to look like something that could be useful.

There are many grains - you can see what's available by running:
salt-call --local grains.ls

The ones you're most likely to use in Qubes are -
id: maps to qube name
os: e.g Debian
os_family: e.g Debian
oscodename: e.g. stretch

But these might be useful too:

locale_info:
ip4_interfaces:
virtual_subtype: Xen PV DomU
